# juxta-shop

My Python based Web Scraping project that I made for an E-commerce course as part of my undergraduate program. The project uses two Python based libraries, Beautiful Soup and Tkinter, to run its functionality and UI respectively.

## Working

- The code uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML/XML contents of three e-commerce websites, Flipkart, Snapdeal and Ebay, in order to retrieve product names and their respective prices.

- Using the search field, the user can look up products and get results from three different websites in order to get the most cost effective option. The search results are retrieved into three different columns in order to facilitate a side by side comparison of product prices.

- The user interface is pretty basic and was built using Tkinter.
